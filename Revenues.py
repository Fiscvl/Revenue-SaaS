# Revenue Notes

#  3 types of Revenue, 3 seperate list/sheets for inputs of each type
#  Existing Revenues - list of existing invoices; with collection info
#  Renewal Revenues - renewals of existing contracts, with churn; list of contracts
#  New Revenues - new contracts; scale with employees, employee scale list

#  5 lists in each dictonary
#  1)   Revenues/MRR
#  2)   Invoices
#  3)   Deferred
#  4)   Accrued         - Not used for Renewal or New
#  5)   Collections

#  blank row is used for each input line, has 6 vectors for each list,
#  after the line is processed append each  list from blank_row to each of the 6 lists
